    <!-- Task No 2: Create a simple webpage displaying this output.
    Note: This example is of a web page about film festivals. The <h1> element is used with an
    id attribute at the top of the page so that a link can be added to take readers from the bottom
    of the page to the top. There is an email link to allow readers to contact the author of the web
    page. There are also a number of links to qualified URLs. These link to various film festivals.
    Below this list is a link to a relative URL which is an "about" page that lives in the same
    directory. Furthermore, you can make variations like use your own content or give it a much
    better structure). -->
